===========


Naming Conventions
------------------

Use `CapitalizedCamelCase` for classes, structs, enums and namespaces.

Use `CapitalizedCamelCase`, `camelCase` or `snake_case` for functions.

Use `snake_case` for variables.

Underscores also be used in the names of classes, structs, enums, and functions, if they indicate variations of a common principle, such as different implementations of the same idea.

As by common and nearly universal convention, macros must always be in `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`.



No Tabs
-------

No character in the entire source code must be a tab.



Indentation
-----------

Generally, indentation of blocks uses four spaces though exceptions may apply.
