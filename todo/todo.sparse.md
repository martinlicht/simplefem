# Sparse Matrix module 

The sparse matrix module implements the linear operator class 
and provides the framework for operators that are stored 
in common sparse matrix formats.

This includes the following formats:
- Compressed Sparse Rows
- Entry by entry format

This currently has rather low priority for the entire project.

## Basic algorithms

The following basic methods and algorithms shall be used 
for this class. 

- Gerschgorin rows 

- Diagonal solve 
- Left triangular solve 
- Right triangular solve 
- Unit Left triangular solve 
- Unit Right triangular solve 

- check whether diagonal 
- check whether (unit) left/right triangular 

- Input/Output routines
