  
  
  o Gerschgorin circles 
    
    implement the gerschgorin row/column circles 
    and the corresponding maximal estimates 
    
  
  o Different elementary solvers 
    
    Implement solution algorithms for special matrix types:
    - diagonal solve 
    - left/right triagonal solve 
    - unit left/right/ triagonal solve 
    - averages between left and right solves 
    
    
  o Basic functionality
    
    check whether matrix is diagonal or triangular 
    either quantitatively or qualitatively
    
    
  o Implement LU decomposition
    
    The LU decomposition needs to be implemented 
    with different pivoting strategies:
    row, column, or full pivot. 
    
    
  o Implement Cholesky decomposition
  
    The cholesky decomposition needs to be implemented.
    Again, a pivot choice is necessary. 
    
    
  o Stabilized Gram-Schmidt 
  
  
  o QR decomposition
