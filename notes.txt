 * Provide software for rapid prototyping of tensor-valued finite element methods over simplicial grids.
 * Gain practical experience in the implementation of FEEC 
 
 * YES: Maintainability, Flexibility, Produce qualitative results
 * NO: Performance, industry

 * Features for the future:
 * * ( Learn VTK and ParaView ) (2d)
 * * VTK output of meshes (1d)
 * * mesh refinement in several dimensions (10h)
 * * product operators, operator block matrices (5h)
 * * better preconditioners (4h)
 * * move semantics for floatvectors and densematrices (3h)
 * * parallelism (lots and lots)
