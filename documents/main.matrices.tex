\begin{abstract}
 THis informal document describes the construction of finite element matrices 
 in the contex to finite element exterior calculus.
 We consider the mass matrix, derivative and trace matrices,
 and some auxiliary constructions.

\section{Global to Local Matrix}

Whitney forms are associated to subsimplices of the triangulation. 
Furthermore, boundary conditions are imposed by filtering out certain subsimplices.
We define the matrix which maps the continuous space of Whitney forms
to the broken space of piecewise Whitney forms.
