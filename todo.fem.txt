    General remarks:
    
    We use ordered spanning sets for all vector spaces. 
    That is precisely what defines the matrix structure 
    for any given operator. 

    Element matrices 
    - independent of the dimension
    - use the canonical ordered spanning sets
    - ordering dependent on combinatorial algorithms.

    o Construct mass matrix for barycentric polynomials
      in canonical basis.
      
    o Construct the barycentric differential matrix 
      The construction requires ordered coordinates of a simplex.
      Should be given rather as the difference matrix
      of the edges, so that it's dimension-independent.
    
    o Construct the generalized cofactor matrix
      Necessary for the higher order differential forms.

    o Construct mass matrix for polynomial differential forms 
      This is only a kronecker product of the former.
      
    
    o degree elevation 
      increases the polynomial degree formally 
      
    o extension operators

      - polynomial sullivan mit randbedingungen
