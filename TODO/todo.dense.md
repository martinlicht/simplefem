  
# (LOW) Gerschgorin circles 
  
  implement the gerschgorin row/column circles and the corresponding maximal estimates 

# Different elementary solvers 
  
  Implement solution algorithms for special matrix types:
  - diagonal solve 
  - left/right triagonal solve 
  - unit left/right/ triagonal solve 
  - averages between left and right solves 
  
# (LOW) Check diagonal and triangular

# (LOW) Implement LU decomposition with different strategies 
  
  The LU decomposition needs to be implemented 
  with different pivoting strategies:
  row, column, or full pivot.
