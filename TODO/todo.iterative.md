  ************* Iterative Methods to Implement
  
  o Rewrite algorithms to be complex number stable 
  
    All algorithms should be written in a manner 
    that is also correct when using complex numbers. 
    This should be accompanied by a written exposition
    of Krylov subspace methods.
  
  o Provide Preconditioned variants for all iterative methods
  
    For each iterative method there should be a preconditioned 
    method available. New iterative methods should only be added
    if the preconditioned variant is added too.
  
  o GMRES with Restart 
  
    Implement the generalized minimal residual method
    where the search directions are rebuilt from scratch
    after a fixed number of iteration vectors have 
    been constructed.
    
    
  
  o Richardson iteration 
  
  o Gradient energy descent 
  
  o Gradient residual descent 
  
  o Symmetric Lanczos minimum residual method
